# Jaeger Bindings for PHP OpenTracing API

This is a client-side library that can be used to instrument PHP apps for distributed trace collection,
and to send those traces to Jaeger. See the [OpenTracing PHP API](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-php)
for additional detail.

## Contributing and Developing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

Jaeger client can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require jonahgeorge/jaeger-client-php
```

## Getting Started

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Jaeger\Config;
use OpenTracing\GlobalTracer;

$config = new Config(
    [
        'sampler' => [
            'type' => 'const',
            'param' => true,
        ],
        'logging' => true,
    ],
    'your-app-name'
);
$config->initializeTracer();

$tracer = GlobalTracer::get();

$scope = $tracer->startActiveSpan('TestSpan', []);
$scope->close();

$tracer->flush();
```

## Testing

Tests are located in the `tests` directory. See [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md).
